## ‚úÖ Features So Far

- üìΩÔ∏è Extract a frame from a video
- üñºÔ∏è Manually draw parking spaces using 4-point polygons
- üíæ Save labeled spots to `parking_positions.npy`
- üìÑ Export a human-readable `parking_summary.txt` file with spot count

## üì¶ Project Files & Their Purpose

| File                             | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `extract_frame.py`               | Extracts a representative frame from your video and saves it as `frame_for_parking_selection.jpg`. Used for labeling. |
| `frame_for_parking_selection.jpg` | A still frame from the parking lot footage. You‚Äôll use this to manually define parking spaces. |
| `select_parking_spaces_polygon.py` | Interactive GUI tool. Click 4 corners to form each parking space polygon. Press `s` to save, `q` to quit. |
| `parking_positions.npy`          | Stores the list of all saved parking spot coordinates as polygons. Used later for detection. |
| `parking_summary.txt`            | Contains a text summary of how many parking spaces were labeled. Automatically generated. |
| `requirements.txt`               | Python dependencies needed to run the project (NumPy, OpenCV). Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. |
| `README.md`                      | Project documentation, setup instructions, and usage guide. |

## üõ† Requirements

> ‚úÖ Tested on **Python 3.11**  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not compatible with Python 3.13+ (due to removed `ImpImporter` support)
